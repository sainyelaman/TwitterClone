- Attempted to implement bonus feature number 2 with the profile page of a user. Created a view controller that pops up when tapping on the profile button. However, could not for the life of me figure out how and which API reference to use without making the user authenticate again to obtain the user id. So, I only the have the empty profile page template. :(
